# ðŸ“Œ Pricing Model: Prepaid API Package (40-Day Coverage with 10-Day Profit)

---

## 1. Concept
We offer clients a **prepaid API usage package**.  

- The package is priced to cover **40 days of GPU hosting costs**.  
- In reality, clients typically consume the package within **30 days**.  
- The extra **10 days equivalent cost** becomes **net profit**.  

This ensures **predictable revenue**, client **discount incentives**, and a **sustainable profit margin**.

---

## 2. Cost Assumptions
- GPU hosting (example): **$1,200/month (~$40/day)** for always-on infrastructure.  
- 30 days hosting = **$1,200 cost**.  
- 40 days hosting = **$1,600 package price**.  

Thus, selling the package at **$1,600**:  
- **$1,200** â†’ covers actual infra costs (30 days).  
- **$400 (10 days)** â†’ profit margin.
